The applied metaphysical mechanics derive from the nondeterministic state of being


κψ = α + β + γ + δ + σ
κψ = α × β × γ × δ × σ


an associative notation to reduce a nondeterministic spatial description such as


κ = α+ + β- + γ- + δ+ + σ+
κ = α+ × β- × γ- × δ+ × σ+


to the short hand representation


αβδσ .


The brief form permits the directionality found in the binary relationship


κ = α+ + β- + γ- + δ+ + σ+
κ = α+ × β- × γ- × δ+ × σ+
ψ = α- + β+ + γ+ + δ- + σ-
ψ = α- × β+ × γ+ × δ- × σ-


to αδσκ-βγψ.  While the circumscription of large possibility spaces is ambiguous until employed with long form illumination, it is able to relate psychophysiological understanding to general description.


The power of the notation αβ-βα is clear with the understanding of this basic psychophysiological dynamic.  Likewise, the prevalence of βγσ-σγβ empowers this representation.  And, the field indicates to the practitioner of a discipline of self awareness the importance of the musculature of the inner consciousness as in αβγσ-σγβα.  This, typical mode of being in a relatively social, non-intimate context is one aware of the metaphysical intercourse of daily life.  In contrast, the stateful dynamic βγσ-σγβ is at least defensive, and sometimes offensive to “one with eyes to see, and ears to hear”, αβγσ-σγβα.

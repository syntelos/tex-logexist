At the center of our universe is a mind-body unity, consciousness.  The sentience that emerged from the physical universe is metaphysical.  


The epistemology of metaphysics began with the theory of measurement and the compassion of humanity, and developed through instrumentation and humanity.  With language, tools.  Logic is reproducible and testable.  Epistemology ensures reliability, and the integrity of logic.  Each metaphysical discipline develops metaphysical wealth.  The discipline of self awareness and micrometaphysical musculature is fundamental to every occasion.  Metaphysical and physical communication requires metaphysical and physical experience, learning, discipline, and musculature.


With a discipline of musculature comes the joy of performance.  Each occasion of sense or action is affected, metaphysically, with the micrometaphysical performance that yields the utility and fairness of the occasion of experience.  With the strength of the inner consciousness, the mind’s eye, and the outer consciousness, the beauty of sense and joy of effect dominate the polluted habits of the social esoterica that degrade the sense and effect of occasion.

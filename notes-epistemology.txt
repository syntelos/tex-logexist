The observation of the self is our metaphysical domain, the awareness
of self our existentialism, and the discipline over our need of
knowledge our logical epistemology.  Briefly, the following is an
effort in logical existentialism.

The homo sapien is a genetic entity that reproduces itself across
generations.  The individual has need of knowledge, κ, soul, ι,
others, σ, and reproduction, ρ, in the pursuit of this life.

The observation of the self yields the force of life that projects the
individual into a state of genetic success or failure.  From our
experience observing nature as recorded to physics we differentiate
the effective product, force, from causation, energy, in the
identification of the invariant of existential theory, ψ.

We know this individual as ψ, and can represent the set of invariants
to our self awareness as interacting within the individual as
  ψ = κ + ι + σ + ρ, 
and more energetically as
  ψ = κ × ι × σ × ρ.

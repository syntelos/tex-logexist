There’s an interesting relationship between power and vanity and the academic cause and effect.  The cause of entry into a field of effort and the effect of effort in a field of work depend on a spiritual and intellectual force of will.  


The motivation of entry and effort emerges from intellect, the comprehension of experience.  Work in the field, near or far, is digested and produced in the metaphysical domain.  Realizing a cause, and then an effect, is a sensitive process requiring fellowship and guidance as well as discipline and training.

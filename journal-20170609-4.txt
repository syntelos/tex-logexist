The world structure as relates to self preservation is a member of the esoterica of consciousness as an abstraction in memory derived from experience and learning.  There can be no doubt that historically the  world view is derived from experience.  Before language there was experience.  With language, an evolution through abstraction that has been increasingly objective or logical or epistemological or reliable with respect to the passing of knowledge from old to young, with respect to the condensation of operable or tangible or useful knowledge from the abstraction of experience.  With language and knowledge, learning and tools.


The structure of the world relates to self preservation through the degree of interdependence.  The postindustrial economy represents the height of interdependence.  Self preservation, and thereby the peace and dignity required by the inner consciousness, depends on the world order.  When the world view is perturbed, the inner consciousness demands a correction which may emote in violence, subjective or objective.  The outer consciousness may conclude that war or alternative variations of collectivism will eventually correct the perceived problem.  Ideally, according to efficiency, the offending component of the macrometaphysical world is corrected rather than a manifestation to overwhelm the offending component.  The sight of these possibilities is realized within to distill actuality to pragmatism, and deliver peace and dignity regardless of the state of the macrometaphysical world.

A metaphysical simile exists on the social consciousness which illustrates the unique character of this center of consciousness.  In particular, how αβγ and γβα occur and how to become aware of this mode of consciousness.  


We think of the identity complex in a number of ways.  Inwardly in the conceit and image of self, and outwardly in the personal affiliation and reputation.  The term complex represents an unfamiliar structure.  As an acculturation of the social consciousness, the identity complex varies in the complexity or magnitude of its character among individuals.  


The development of the concept into abstractions of recognition and understanding among the esoterica of consciousness has created a tool of substantial presence and power for the identification and characterization of the psychophysiological feature identified as the social consciousness.  If one reflects on the presence of the identity complex in the thoughts, attitudes, and judgements of life in metaphysically commercial spaces including the grocery store or television, one will be found in the social consciousness in comparison with the metaphysical experience of solitude or nature.

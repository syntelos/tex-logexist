The force or power of the social consciousness, a psychophysiological feature of the homo sapien, is substantial to the macrometaphysical similes of reality complex and belief system.  We each have constructed, among the abstractions of the esoterica of consciousness, disciplines of self awareness, preservation, and conservation that serve the integration of being socially, as through the methods of seeming.  These complex systems of belief are so critical, the social consciousness so powerful, that violations to our respective social integration system of understanding cause dissonance and dissociation -- well known phenomena of cognitive impairment.

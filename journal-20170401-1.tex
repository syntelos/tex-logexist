Cognition is a dynamic composition of neural networks.  Description
the recycling of the static or transient neural networks of memory.
It's no wonder that the walk of technology is dominated by problems in
the composition and decomposition of thought.

The psycho-perceptual comforts of continuity, presence and persistence
do not obscure the mechanics of recognition, abstraction and
imagination.  Nor the mechanics of spirituality, sexuality, society,
intellect and identity.

It is responsibility for the energies of our passions that enables the
depth of interaction and cooperation necessary to produce significant
force, to convert energy to action, construction.

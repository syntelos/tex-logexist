\input preamble

The art of life adapts mind and body to situation according to body
meaning and experience.  Body meaning envelops the intuition afforded
by the human existence.  It is our experience within this self that
lends meaning and significance to actions and words.  

The world including the body is immersive.  We necessarily look within
to find grounding and orientation under the trees and the stars.  From
the inner consciousness within we can see the outer consciousness that
senses and knows and interacts with the world that is unique from the
individual.

The emotions are the speech from within the inner consciousness.
Common social emotional behavior includes the need for some reflection
on my output that I may understand it.  This need is for knowledge of
the inner consciousness as substantial and significant to life.

Once we have mastered the balancing of inner and outer consciousness,
language and mind, {\it etc.}, we learn that the adaptations that are
the work pieces of (metaphysical) life are inhibited behaviors trained
by experience and learning.  Like the muscles that give and take to
produce motion in a limb, the muscles of life action and being give
and take in the motion of adaptation.

To learn this is to know the rotations, extensions, retractions,
exercise and flexing that inhabit (the space of metaphysical) life.
In this knowledge one may minimize stress and maximize consciousness
as free to conserve the energies within.

\input preamble

To understand consciousness, to know the facilities of the {\it homo
sapien}, is to know peace.  Let me explain.  

Knowing that the inner consciousness (heart) exists as a peer to the
outer consciousness (mind), that the inner consciousness is the source
of emotion, and that the emotional products of the inner consciousness
reflect the appearances in the outer consciousness, one necessarily
deduces that self preservation requires the invention of thought.

In the metaphysical or subjective realm of the self, it is thought
(equivalently experience, or the state of the outer consciousness)
that determines the emotional state of the inner consciousness.  It is
senseless to maintain any thought or state of being that produces pain
unnecessarily.  

Hang in balance of weight or substance the pain versus the thought and
discard the thought that fails to outweigh the pain it causes.
Replace it with any suitable alternative that dispells the pain.  In
such a case, given sanity and reason, one has succeeded in delivering
oneself (or another) from an insanitary condition.

Likewise the reinvention of self follows as a continuous process, and
resistence to the evolution of thought and being represented by the
term reinvention is not healthy.

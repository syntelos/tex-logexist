There exists a macrometaphysical simile shared among the micrometaphysical esoterica derived from the socioeconomic “haves and have nots” that reflects the micrometaphysical αβ-βα dynamic.


In terms of primary sources of macrometaphysical catalysts in the United States, a great deal of pollution emerges along educational boundaries.  This particular catalyst is produced and employed politically in a vicious cycle of self mutilation.


We commonly refer to the phenomenon as the “self fulfilling prophecy”.  It could be classified as the null, or degenerate case in a spectrum of metaphysical induction.  The feedback loop in a macrometaphysical αβγ-γβα system is a degenerate form of the relatively purposeful αβγκ-γβαψ induction.  This spectrum of occasion extends over predator, disease, and victim classes.  The micrometaphysical disease in γβα is differentiated from the αβγ perpetrator and predator, and the γβα victim.  


Classes of aggression are differentiated between the classes identified as perpetrator and predator.  The minor class exploits opportunity for self preservation, and the major class exploits the opportunity to the self destructive significand.  


The ultimate outcome of the metaphysical predator’s tactics and strategy is its own self destruction.  In the macrometaphysics, the predator represents a particular self destructive strategy.  For example, aggressive negative behavioral obsession, broadcasting, interaction, replication and reproduction.  Beyond the betrayal of self, the betrayal of its own genetic entity and obsessive aggressive partnership with breathing and genetic entities captured by the same disease.  The actuality is, apparently, a manifestation of a σγβ-βγσ syndrome.

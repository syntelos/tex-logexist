\input preamble

A metaphysical utility is a value derived from a metaphysical experience.  The value of the experience of an accident is the knowledge of the existence of accidents.  For the benefit of abstraction we may elect to define the value of the experience of an accident as nil in order to relate positive and negative values to a value of zero or nil or void.  Likewise, the value derived from a metaphysical income is a metaphysical profit or loss.  And, the fairness of the experience of an occasion is a value on the scale of frustrated, fair, or satisfied.  We prefer to not relate the quality of the experience of an accident as fair.  Therefore, the utility of the experience of communication is related on dimensions of abstraction or derivation including sensual and informational derivations of communication.

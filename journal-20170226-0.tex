\input preamble


Across the history of language we have developed our arts of
communication to lead the reader to the comprehension of thought.  An
individual may grasp within the moment of reading (study) a concept
developed through extensive research.  With such tools of development
we maintain and develop (and defend!) no less than human
consciousness.

The altitudes of consciousness achieved by humanity are preserved by
communication, and this is as important and precious as a newborn.
Technically, as significant as a generation and the generations in its
future, but the concept overwhelms so the reachable and recognizable
principle of the one is upheld with this force of human faith.

It was from within the practice of Christianity, a Maximalist Humanism, that I first identified and characterized the spiritual potential.  The message of individual, family, and social love is there projected onto a celestial sphere in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost which Christians develop into a full aperture of awareness of human potential.  That it is the relationships in self and family and society that are central to the development of the spiritual potential of the individual.


The spiritual potential of the individual is central to the development of the productive or contributive potential of the individual.  Of course society is a collection of individuals, and its health or function or operation depends on the state of each individual.  That society has progress or motion or development is material.  A cartesian separation or dualism is substantial to the issue.  Whether or not the population expands and wealth grows is independent of the health of our society.  This is a spiritual or emotional issue, and this can be encompassed within 
ψ= α + β + γ
as the spiritual or emotional health of each individual.

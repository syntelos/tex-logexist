The issue in “self awareness” is a lack of cultural and social familiarity with the interior senses of the interactions between the inner consciousness and the outer consciousness.  The interior subconscious interacts with the exterior consciousness producing feelings that are neither recognized nor discussed.  


Sleep anxiety reflects the descent into subconscience, and emotional immaturity reflects a sustained attachment to the subconscience from childhood.  Likewise the dynamics of consciousness involve subjective and objective state changes in the use of lower and higher reasoning skills.  


There are many interactions, some of which are forceful and some of which are subtle, each available to the interior conscious senses.  Anxiety over these senses is responsible for the sublimation or repression of self awareness as the reception and acknowledgement of these feelings.

We look up into the sky, and reflect on the planet we stand on.  Our physical and metaphysical state requires our attention.  Our physical and metaphysical environments are not healthy.  By the measure of responsibility for ourselves, or the future of our children, we have an obligation to respond to the condition of our physical and metaphysical environmental issues.


In a longer perspective we can consider the long term future of humanity.  The probability of our enduring our possible existence is an existential expression in multiple dimensions: the expression of the present value of existence, the expression of the future value of existence, and the expression of the possible value of existence.  In a longer perspective we have returned to the analysis that delivers immediately.


The ways and means of practical existence intersect the meaning of existence where the mind-body unity waits and sleeps.  The metaphysics intersect physics at each occasion of sensient experience.  Individually and socially, we endeavor to understand the meaning of life physically and metaphysically, each according to our own methods and devices.

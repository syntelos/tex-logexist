\input preamble

It is plainly evident that the use of the mind as a machine, a
computer, is ineffective and undesireable.  That it might be
productive or interesting a false conceit.  That it might be proposed
as work, inhumane.  

The capacity of intellect is creative and constructive following the
force of consciousness and the energy of life.  

Humanity has cardinality, directionality.  This direction is to
produce, to create -- to endeavor in the development of its best
projection, the potential of the individual and the species.

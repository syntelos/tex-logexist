A macrometaphysical simile is an abstraction from experience and learning that is shared among the esoterica of consciousness.  A word is learned by meaning, reflection, and association.  


As it is reinforced by the experience of its occasion, the magnitude of its simile among the esoterica builds.  The metaphysical experience of the simile is the cause of confusion and disease.  The reinforcement of diverse reflections and associations has diluted the genuine meaning by misunderstanding and aggression.  


The perspective on meaning that is reading and study with the peace and dignity of αβ has been displaced, among the esoterica of consciousness, by psychophysiological association to βγσ, the social awareness of esoterica.  This is the mechanism of macrometaphysical pollution.

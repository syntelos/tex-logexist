An analysis of the use of the term simile first yields the long form intent.  Like the truth, but not true.  The spatial form is first a dipole from term to original meaning as true, and the diluted in rays of association from term to untrue.  Therefore a star diagram with the term at center, one edge true and many edges not true.  A fuzzy logic may employ probabilistic truth, or contextual semantics.  In the discrete logic of epistemology we maintain, simply, true and not true.  This analysis yields the benefit of metaphysical utility and fairness, undoing the harm of mistaken association as the macrometaphysical pollution of experience.


The micrometaphysical metaphor is a dipole that has unbearable truth.  The bearing is unsupportable.  While truth is found at both ends of the edge or ray of association, the association (itself) is a subjective dilution that drains utility and fairness from its nodes or terminals.


Two first examples of metaphysical metaphor are the terms selfishness and vanity.  The interior of their truth is just and human, while the exterior of their employment is rarely just and human but typically derogatory or denouncing of poor micrometaphysical health.  A healthy mind-body unity has selfishness and vanity that are naturally occuring components of metaphysics, while these terms are commonly employed in a form that is loaded with the macrometaphysical pollution of macrometaphysical metaphor.  The awareness of the terms selfishness and vanity requires this understanding.  


It is the macrometaphysical state of being that yields the macrometaphysical metaphor, hence the identification of the macrometaphysical obstruction as pollution.  The identification and characterization of the macrometaphysical obstruction is capable of clearing the pollution from our macrometaphysical state of being.

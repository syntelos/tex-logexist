The mind’s eye opens slightly, or narrowly, in sensing the mood of a room of friends and family.  In the situation that is familiar and warm but not free of potential emotional impacts.  With an opening between the inner and outer consciousness, we can sense affection and feel the warmth of society.  We might say that a wall persists to protect the moral fabric of being within from the world without.  In this αβ we know affection.  The operation of the αβ-βα dwells in αβ with awareness βα sensed in warmth.

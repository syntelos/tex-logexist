At Columbia I took Sidorsky’s review of recent events in Philosophy.  True to my nature, I spoke up given the opportunity and having some lit neurons.  He made the case for Logical Positivism in contrast Metaphysics in a format that was readily accessible.  The message resonated with me.  I could take that home.  One day on College Walk he stopped me, daughter in tow, and asserted something within.  In a virtual sense he handed me Foucault’s Mots and asked what it meant.  


It was only yesterday that the incredible gift could be realized.

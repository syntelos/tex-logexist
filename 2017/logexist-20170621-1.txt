During the evolutions in the two decades before adulthood, the individual is constantly evolving.  We wake in change, and then change halts.  In the decades following development, the individual faces the stillness of maturity.  The relative silence contrasts the sounds from within, expression and emotion.


The sounds from within have force of pleasure and pain, location of place to work and walk, and sense of meaning and state.  By these features of experience we know everything that we know.


The outer consciousness of intellect, β, the popular interpretation of the term consciousness, has the capacity of language and logic that provides physical and metaphysical tools.  The inner consciousness, α, is the force of life, interpreter of meaning, and soul of peace and dignity.  The inner consciousness conserves the self by demanding self preservation.  


When the micrometaphysical aperture between the inner and outer consciousness is open, when we are honest with ourselves, the inner consciousness will ensure the veracity of the efforts of the outer consciousness.  Conversely, when the mind’s eye is closed, the outer consciousness is free to deny the inner consciousness.  The individual separated or divorced from the inner consciousness is alienated from the wealth of the self, and is a component of the world.  


With eyes to see and ears to hear I know my self as I know my mother.  One of the first structures to form among the esoterica of consciousness is the character of those in the initial environment of the child.  Their identities form among the memories of intellect.  The heart of the mother is learned as a mirror to compare to one’s own experience.  The heart of the self, the inner consciousness, is thus revealed through the experience of the self and others.

We know a great deal about the inner consciousness.  We depend on each other for every dimension of the conservation of self, including preservation and reproduction.  We are highly sensitive to the differentiation of βγ from αβγ.  We are very sensitive to the presence of compassion.  We have developed a great deal of macrometaphysical wealth under the rubric of trust, within the territory of the inner consciousness.

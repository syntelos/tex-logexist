The spirit and mind are the first instruments of theory and practice.  This is cause for elucidation identified as metaphysics.


The metaphysial domain has uncertainty and incompleteness.  As a result, its analysis is abstract from these issues.  The context of language and communication so differs from the objective of analysis that the crispness of mathematical logic is subjugated by the uncertainty and incompleteness of the human metaphysical domain.


The metaphysical dynamical system may not have an observable temporal domain.  In ANW’s Reflections he describes the dynamic of self satisfaction deriving a future from a past in a complexity that exists beyond the resolution of the temporal sense of process.  “Why did I do that?  I don’t know.”.  The process of cause cannot be traced because it cannot be ordered sequentially according to the demands of language, speech, and communication.

To understand Reality one must recognize Metaphysical Immersion.  When the outer consciousness (β) stands alone in a derivation of conflict and peace from perception, simulating or displacing the rôles of the inner (α) and social (γ) consciousnesses and thereby disturbing the balance available to
ψ = α + β + γ,
ψ = α × β × γ.


The subjective bed of Childhood held too close is one such state.  Likewise fiction may frame (φ) love and affection (self, ψ) to transport perception (φ > φψ) to plastic worlds of composition in which reality is manipulated or projected or analyzed.

The macrometaphysical state of being, the state of our macrometaphysical universe, is


ψΜ = αΜ + βΜ + γΜ + δΜ + σΜ.


There is no human experience of the macrometaphysical existence, κΜ.  It is unknowable, epistemologically nonexistent, and therefore we have no use of the term κΜ until we should elect to touch God.


The macrometaphysical universe includes the extrinsic or relatively physical or intellectual components, βΜ, as well as the intrinsic or relatively implicit or animated components, αΜ.  The macrometaphysical extrinsics include government and media.  The macrometaphysical intrinsics include understandings and beliefs and the participation of individuals.


Participation in the occasion of intercourse or communication, participation in the macrometaphysics, occurs by purpose of self preservation and conservation or by purpose of exploitation and predation.  It should be obvious that the former is a human necessity, and the later is a human error.  As the former contributes to the development of macrometaphysical wealth, the latter is a source of macrometaphysical pollution.

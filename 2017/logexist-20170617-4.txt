The identification of the behavior of consciousness by reflection from within self awareness poses the measurement and instrument problem familiar to metaphysics.  The study of the metaphysics is concerned with subjective material that eludes the objective reproducibility familiar to physics.  The validation of metaphysics is individual.  The necessity of the study of metaphysics and the sensitivity of subjective discourse to error necessitates a degree of discipline in science and self awareness.

Each has gateway characteristics within the self awareness.

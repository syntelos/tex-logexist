  conscience

    conscience is the abstraction of "world beliefs" within the inner
    consciousness

    separate from conceptions of "world validity" (coherence world
    view and complementarity of world as viewed with self inherent
    talents and skills and situtation)

    incompleteness

      Metaphysical Incompleteness, or Heidegger's Incompleteness, can be
      employed to represent uncertainty in temporal ordering and
      indeterminate leaves of knowledge of the metaphysical domain (mind
      and spirit of the homo sapien / instrument of theory and practice).

  existential mechanics have limit at the scale of aggregation
  familiar to language, not because the representation is linguistic
  but because the resolution of the outer consciousness ends at within
  the scale of observation we have elevated into language.

    instrumentation

      The spirit and mind are the first instruments of theory and
      practice.  This is cause for elucidation identified as
      metaphysics.

      The metaphysial domain has uncertainty and incompleteness.  As a
      result, its analysis is abstract from these issues.  The context
      of language and communication so differs from the objective of
      analysis that the crispness of mathematical logic is subjugated by
      the uncertainty and incompleteness of the human metaphysical
      domain.

      The metaphysical dynamical system may not have an observable
      temporal domain.  In ANW’s Reflections he describes the dynamic of
      self satisfaction deriving a future from a past in a complexity
      (that exists beyond the resolition of the temporal sense of
      process [TBD]).  “Why did I do that?  I don’t know.”.  The process
      of cause cannot be traced because it cannot be ordered
      sequentially according to the demands of language, speech, and
      communication.

    language

      via [ANW/Re] human natural language exists in the metaphysical
      domain (uncertainty in temporality and incompleteness in
      semantics), the pursuit of grammar in natural language
      demonstrates this (abstract) incompleteness.

    thought

    knowledge

    language 

      the representation of [knowledge] in (degrees of) certainty and
      incertainty and confidence and fuzzyness

    metaphysics 

      the [consideration] of mind and experience with respect to the
      arts and sciences as instrument of theory and measurement

    analysis

      recording and dissecting [thought] as instrument to theory and
      measurement

    philosophy

  20170217-0 (language, existentially) would fail this measure as a

  20170226-0 (across the history of language) is a nice bracket

  Across the history of language we have developed our arts of
  communication to lead the reader to the comprehension of thought.
  An individual may grasp within the moment of reading (study) a
  concept developed through extensive research.  With such tools of
  development we maintain and develop (and defend!) no less than human
  consciousness.  

  The altitudes of consciousness achieved by humanity are preserved by
  communication, and this is as important and precious as a newborn.
  Technically, as significant as a generation and the generations in
  its future, but the concept overwhelms so the reachable and
  recognizable principle of the one is upheld with this force of human
  faith.

  a deep look into the dynamical consciousness

      the inner consciousness is beyond the resolution of features from
      the outer consciousness (incompleteness), however the two have a
      far more complex relationship than described earlier.

    individual variances

      it's likely that individual genetics determine individual
      properties of the consciousness

    interactions within

      the interactions and sensitivities of the consciousness are
      available to the consciousness

    living structures

      memories and behaviors within the consciousness have lifecycles
      that are available to the consciousness

  + metaphysical instrumentation
  + performance in the humanities
  = social contract

  The conception is inverted.  It is the individual upon which society
  depends, in health and happiness for the social manifestation of the
  general good.

  Likewise in the monotheistic religion (as a point of common
  reference in the origin of humanism), God resides within the
  individual as the origin of love and the force of life, rather than
  the church which serves to elicit self awareness from within the
  individual.

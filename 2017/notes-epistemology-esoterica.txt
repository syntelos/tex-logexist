Within the complexity of the mind-body identity, unity, there is the esoterica beyond the epistemology of existence.  The invariants of the esoterica reflect the invariants of conscience.  And the invariants of conscience reflect the invariants of character including ambition.  That the body is a form of life, breathing a finite breath of air.  That fidelity to this existence requires faith of conscience over the disposal of this finite blessing of existence.  The health and well being of the mind-body identity, ψ, require balance and peace; love according to the character of the individual.

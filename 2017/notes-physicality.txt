The physical domain external to the body meets the metaphysical domain
of the body at a hierarchy of needs, personal economics, the tools,
objects and matter of sustenance, creation, position and projection.

The external world of society shapes access to the economic
physicality, π, in forms that are arbitrary with respect to the
metaphysical identity, ψ.  The freedom of access from ψ to π is a
manifold under conscience and intellect that may blur one’s self
awareness into one’s awareness of situation and means and world.

The separation of self and world is fundamental to self awareness.
The identification, characterization and interaction necessary to the
realization or actualization of self awareness are inhibited by an
intellect uncertain of the distinction, unfamiliar with the
differentiation of self and world.

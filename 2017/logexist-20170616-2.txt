When, in the course of human events, the cause of humanity coincides with the course of justice on the world stage such that the invisible becomes visible we are empowered to employ our media with our hearts and minds to support and defend right over wrong, awareness over ignorance, and consciousness over disease.  It is in this moment that the force of life born within is held and celebrated to the benefit of humanity.

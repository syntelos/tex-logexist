One must differentiate power from coincidence, mercenary from volunteer, minimalism from modesty to see it.  It is the fact that I have no power beyond the power of the vote.  I have no magic beyond the natural force of mind and spirit.  


Further to the point, the conceit of power does injury to the bearer.  It is not true, the belief of which is a conceit in vanity and relevance that obscures the need to think and stand and to take and hold the possession of one’s inalienable human rights.

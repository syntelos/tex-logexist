Mathematics is the pure thought?  By it's own admission it has no
object.  Such a degree of purity discards thought, I submit.  That an
element of thought collapses to a point, as the elements of
mathematical language, a coincidence of awareness and description.
Mathematics is that degree of freedom that differentiates the
quaternion from the vector, a foundation from a structure.  The high
science is objective.  It is physics.  It was the reinvention of
physics from 1895 to 1911 that held us in a gasp of breath for a
century.  What was objective changed under it because we had not yet
wrought of it a foundation, an epistemology of existence (I submit).

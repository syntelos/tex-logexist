It is the female body that is the greater sexual awareness.  From a very early age, the female is attuned to the significance of our sexuality.  Long before the male, she becomes aware of reproduction.  By kindergarten, the female is on her way to the awareness of physical maturation while the male suspects nothing in particular.  By puberty the female is well aware of sexual reproduction, and the male may yet remain relatively unaware of the significance for the female.  The relatively accelerated development of the female leads to a greater sense of metaphysical utility or values or principles.  The significance of micrometaphysical health and macrometaphysical wealth in the dimension of physical security is more obvious to her than it is to him.  He only cautiously and tenuously enters into the awareness of the implications of reproduction.  According to the confines of education and acculturation, he discovers his forces of life and nesting, and then perhaps childbearing and rearing, as he searches his strengths and talents in his adult situation.  His micrometaphysical awareness is far less self evident, would occur later than hers, if he suffers the typical absence of her experience.

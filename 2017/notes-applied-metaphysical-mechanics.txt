The applied mechanics of logical existentialism need to describe
phenomena such as
* vanity, 
* pride, 
* the blessings of the holy spirit, 
* matrimonial bliss, 
* humility, 
* arrogance,
* missing a loved one,
* solitude,

As music resonates over consciousness independent of semantics known
or knowable (incompleteness) by the outer consciousness, the applied
mechanics of logical existentialism have limit at the aggregation
familiar to language.

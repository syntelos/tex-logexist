Meditation is a practice of balancing the consciousness within the spiritual state of being.  It is the highest form of practice by virtue of uniqueness of purpose.  Alternative forms depend on a relative crutch.  


In my own experience I would work on software in a meditative state that opened the entirety of mind and spirit to an effort, and produced wonderous results.  I called it “jacking in” for the humor in its oddity.  The experience was fulfilling and the practice discipling with respect to my objectives, physical and metaphysical.  Unlike meditation, the practice depends on a situation.  Without it, I am at a loss in comparison with a practitioner of meditation.

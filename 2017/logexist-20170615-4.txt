The mature coupling, according to this experience of the heterosexual case, is bound within α, the inner consciousness.  From within, the outer consciousness of β + γ + δ + σ is the variable journeys of minutes and hours and days and years and decades.  The well founded couple is a singular whole from the perspective of the inner consciousness, α.  From the outer consciousness, β, the couple is entirely distinct.  It is two, independent individuals whose respective vitality is as critical to the whole couple as it is to each respective inner consciousness.  The rituals of joining or bonding develop the coming in and moving out of intimate contact, α, with the progression of increasingly profound trust and dependence in the α musculature.  Likewise, the αβ-βα dynamic of each individual develops a coupled or shared musculature of balance so that αβ meets βα, and vice versa, and then the inward βα and the outward αβ meet according to being and seeming.  The shared metaphysical musculature is the comfort, habitude, and practice of the couple.

Consciousness is a web of interoperating centers of consciousness.

$$\kappa = \alpha \times \beta \times \gamma \times \delta \times \sigma$$

The whole, $\kappa$, is the awareness of the mind-body identity in the
first person, or the psychological character of the other in the
second person.  These representations reflect the limits of
comprehension of self referred to as Heideggerâ€™s Incompleteness.

The product of the interoperating elements of this system, $\kappa$,
is far greater than the sum of the components.

$$\psi = \alpha + \beta + \gamma + \delta + \sigma$$

The sum of these components, $\psi$, represents a static conception of
the system of consciousness.  The product of these components
represents a dynamic conception of the system of consciousness.

The iniquity of a lack of guidance.  The iniquity of a lack of spirituality.  The iniquity of this greed in the world.  The beauty overwhelming of a capitulation to it.


The need for divinity.  A sense of spirituality independent of material that enables the destitute to receive fellowship.  The need for the recognition of the intelligence of the intellect of the homo sapien, universalized.  The need for the recognition of the spirituality of the interior of the homo sapien, universalized.


The need for the recognition of the cost of the denial of these social, universal truths in favor of the pursuit of self preservation.


Separating us from these needs stands pollution and poverty.  The pollutions and poverties that affect the mind.

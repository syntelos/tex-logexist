Socioeconomic entropy is raised by physical and metaphysical violence, and lowered by the development of socioeconomic value and utility.  


A viable fitness function is macrometaphysical fidelity.  The development of macrometaphysical wealth requires humanity, a sense of self awareness, social justice, and community contribution.  The fitness of a socioeconomic venture or endeavor is proportional to its contribution to macrometaphysical health, and inversely proportional to its contribution to socioeconomic entropy.


While one may consider markets as objective, people are subjective.  The objective fairness of occasion is also a subjective fairness of occasion.  We seek to maximize utility subject to the fairness of occasion.  Sometimes the utility object is physical, while the fairness object is always metaphysical.


In the common case, self preservation is physical and metaphysical.  In the economic case, profit and loss is physical and risk is metaphysical.


A socioeconomic venture or endeavor must solve a broad and deep array of constraints for long term success.  In some fields this is no harder than commitment and effort, while in other fields the challenge is beyond individual capacity and faith must be placed beyond the micrometaphysical envelope.
